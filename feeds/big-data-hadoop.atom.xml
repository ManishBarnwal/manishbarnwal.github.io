Hadoop sounds scary to a lot of people and I am no exception. In this post, I would make an attempt to explain HIVE-the data warehouse for Hadoop ecosystem.Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is HIVE? And why as an analyst I should care about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HIVE is the part of the Hadoop infrastructure where data gets stored and you can write your query to fetch data from HIVE (tables). Now when I had started working on Hadoop, I knew a little SQL and a tad little of data science. I had take a few courses on Statistics during my college but then who really studies in college! Having allocated to a project which required an understanding of Hadoop, I planned how I need to understand this system so that I can contribute my best to the project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Hive"></category><category term="hadoop"></category><category term="big data"></category></entry></feed>
