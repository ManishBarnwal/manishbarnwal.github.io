&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Having graduated from college, I joined WalmartLabs as Statistical analyst in the year 2014. We were a batch of four freshers, all from different colleges — one from IISc. Bangalore, two from ISI Kolkata, and I from IIT Kharagpur. We were the first batch of freshers to join the data science team. There were three seniors to guide us through the on-boarding formalities and getting to know the Walmart systems.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I clearly remember the first few days of the office. I used to be super excited everyday. I used to feel like there is so much to learn. There was a spark of learning that kept me excited. I worked at WalmartLabs for close to three years. People say, the first company is always special. And I won’t deny this. I have enjoyed my days at WalmartLabs. The stay here was packed with learnings, great friends, and wonderful experiences.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Today as I reckon how the last three years has passed, I think to myself what I could have done better? What were a few things that I took way too seriously. What could I have done better? What were my learnings?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Below are my learnings from the 1000 days I have spent working in a corporate job.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t hesitate to ask questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I had joined as a fresher, there were so many terms I had never heard of. WFH, WebEx, EDLP, EDLC were alien to me. Technology wise, I had never worked on R. But that never discouraged me asking questions whenever I got stuck. And the earlier you clarify these questions the better for you. You don’t want to ask the fresher-tagged questions after one year of your employment. Moreover, asking questions clarify concepts. So, ask as many questions as possible.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;New phase. Write a new story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new phase of life after college. We all are excited about it. This is a chance for you get a better version of yourself. You are surrounded by new people. You have a fresh page to start with. You can write a new story or continue with the story you have been living in your college. If there is something you want to change in your life. This is the time. When everyone around you is new. You don’t have your old people to drag you down. It’s a great opportunity to overcome any challenges or weaknesses from your past.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your 9-to-5 job is not enough for your learnings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be under the impression that your project will teach you all. There will always be gaps in your learnings. Bridge these gaps with your personal projects. I participate in hacks, read books, write codes for personal projects, and then blog about them. This keeps me motivated. Choose what you truly want to learn. This shall excite you and keep you on top of the learning curve.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;First impressions are exaggerated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First impressions are exaggerated — be it a good one or a bad one. Let time pass by and then decide. The bad thing about first impressions is that people forget to update it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don’t get busy in 9 to 5 cycle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is very easy to get comfortable in the 9–5 daily cycle and the weekly Monday-to-Friday cycle. Time flies week by week and you won’t even realize that you completed a year of your job. Learn new skills — be it boxing, guitar or anything you always wanted to learn. Weekends should not be looked upon as your lazy days.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save money. Don’t waste all your money on beers, drinks, and getting yourself pampered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a year of job, I realized I had not saved enough. Saving is a practice. Inculcate it. It is up to you how much you want to save. It could be as simple as opening a recurrent deposit account.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Your manager should be aware of all your work.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure you and your manager frequently connect to discuss the work you are doing. Always ask for feedback. Any improvement in any area that is required of you. If your manager doesn’t have answer to your questions, ask a senior you trust and respect.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;You are the average of 5 people you spend your most time with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is one mantra in life I follow whole-heartedly, it is this one. You are the average of five people you spend your most time with. So choose your group wisely.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Be the go to person.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how many blogs or books you read, if you don’t solve real problems you won’t learn. Try to solve as many problems as possible. Become an expert of your skill. You should be seen as the go-to-person for this topic by people in your office. This will expose you to solve new problems and enhance your learnings.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Don’t get excited by hike. Let your work excite you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is easier said than done. I will be lying if I say that I abide by this. I try to find peace and excitement in the work I am doing. Always ask the question — Why am I doing this? How will this help in the bigger picture? Try to relate yourself to the learnings from the work you are doing. If you are interested in your work, hike will come automatically as a byproduct. Never work just for hikes.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Give chance to your juniors. Always.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are a senior, you have a different responsibility of nurturing your juniors. Pass on your learnings to them. Don’t look upon your juniors as the resource to do your shittiest work. Once they become senior, they will realize this and hate you for this. When presented with an opportunity, give chance to your juniors to present the solution.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Find a mentor. The right one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mentor is one who knows your problems, has faced similar problems in the past, and has answer to your problems. There will be times when nothing will work in your favor. You want to come out of the muddle. But you don’t know how. Your mentor will be your hero. I was fortunate to have some of my seniors as best mentors — Jeeban, Pralabh, and Issac. You find yours. The right ones. Not the ones who become your mentor just for the sake of company’s policy.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is obviously not an exhaustive list but for now this is what I have. I will keep visiting this page to add more of my learnings. Please share your thoughts in comments. Share it with people who you think would enjoy reading this.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="corporate lessons"></category><category term="walmart"></category><category term="job"></category><category term="learnings"></category></entry><entry><title>Do you believe in yourself?</title><link href="http://manishbarnwal.github.io/blog/2017/04/03/believe_in_yourself/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2017-04-03T08:00:00-03:00</updated><author><name>Manish Barnwal</name></author><id>tag:manishbarnwal.github.io,2017-04-03:blog/2017/04/03/believe_in_yourself/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Are you a confident person? The mind asked itself. I replied with an excited &lt;em&gt;Yes!&lt;/em&gt;. The mind asked again, &lt;em&gt;are you sure?&lt;/em&gt;. This time I thought for a while but again after a pause, I said &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Why was there a pause the second time?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We humans doubt our capabilities a lot. And what makes us doubt our strengths? A single failure sometimes makes you feel cringed. You feel you are worthless. Life before this failure seems all happy and confident. If you have been confident all your life, how can a single failure shake away the temple of your confidence.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You know the reason? I will tell you. We humans fear failure. A lot. The thought of failure often surpasses the strength of trying it. We are taught from childhood that if you try something and if it doesn’t see the light of success then it is a bad thing. Why can’t we accept and celebrate failures?Now I am not talking about any failure. I am talking about failure where you gave your best. You tried all your means. You presented the best version of yourself.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Recently, I was talking to one of senior colleagues. He has two beautiful daughters. On mundane days, our discussions mostly revolve around deep learning and the new world it is going to present. Today was different. It was a Friday evening.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We happen to discuss about life and the lessons it teaches us. How sports shape your character? How teamwork is not to be seen just on the field playing football. Teamwork is everywhere were more than one person is involved. A person having a team game on his resume gets a plus point according to him. I instantly realized the reason behind this. It is not just about playing in a team. If you play sports, the chances of you failing increases manifold. Every match is either a win or a loss (read failure).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is important to embrace failure gracefully. That way, you won’t fear the thought of failure. A fear can haunt you only till you run away from it. The moment you face it, the fear will be gone. The fear doesn’t know what to do once you accept it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do you feel low when you fail at achieving a goal or fail at delivering a task? Of course! We all do. Imagine you are famished, the first first few swallows of food are divine, right? That’s what success tastes like. It is tantalizing. On the contrary, failure is bland. There is always a feeling of something missing.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now, if you are a confident person, you would have developed your confidence from some of your accomplishments in the past. Some examples of such accomplishments could be- you stood first in your class, you presented in front of a large audience despite all the fear of stammering and dry mouth, you learnt something from scratch and you are very proud of it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now the above examples are personal. Try to remember the tasks and achievements you are proud of. This achievements could be as small as fixing your bathroom door without the help of a carpenter. You fixed it on your own. Know that feeling when you do something uncertain all on your own? If yes, I am talking about such feelings.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
How does these thoughts make you feel like? You feel happy about it. A sense of pride erupts in your body. The neurons in your brain all fire at once like sky shot fireworks. Remember these accomplishments and make this your fuel to lighten you up. Fight back at failure. Roar back at life. You have all the ingredients for the perfect recipe to success.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Treat failure as another chapter of life. And life doesn’t end at just one chapter. It is a long story with indefinite number of pages. Your life can’t be written in one book or 10 books. It is a saga of millions of books. Don’t stop at that chapter. You are the author of the next chapter as well. Decide what you want it to be.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So next time, when failure knocks at your door and gets in your home, welcome it. Let is sit in your home for a weekend. Talk to it. Try to understand it. And then one afternoon gather your ingredients to prepare the delicious meal of success. Failure will never eat that lunch and will jump off your balcony. Now that the failure is gone. Begin the new chapter. You already know the title to that chapter—&lt;em&gt;Believe in yourself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="life"></category><category term="increase confidence"></category><category term="life lessons"></category></entry><entry><title>The filmy Secret Santa</title><link href="http://manishbarnwal.github.io/blog/2016/12/22/filmy_secret_santa/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-12-22T07:00:00-02:00</updated><author><name>Manish Barnwal</name></author><id>tag:manishbarnwal.github.io,2016-12-22:blog/2016/12/22/filmy_secret_santa/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever heard of secret Santa game?

I felt I had gathered the maximum out of this thought but I wanted to write about it so that the mind has to think more on it and may be, just may be, I will be able to know more.
Here’s the thought.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every child learns something or the other from every human it spends time with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This statement sounds more promising when we think about it in this context. We tend to become more like our parents because we spend maximum time with them. Our characters and behaviors are imitated from theirs.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
How does it happen that a &lt;em&gt;baniya&lt;/em&gt;’s son is almost always good in calculations and Maths? Why is that? Why doesn’t it tend to behave more like a musician?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Because, the child spends the maximum time with his parents. He sees the kind of work his father does or the daily chores that his mother gets involved it. He might not be paying much attention to all of this throughout his life. But the brain keeps on peeping through. The unconscious learning happens. Or what we call an &lt;strong&gt;unsupervised&lt;/strong&gt; learning in data-science.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In the long run, the best learning happens when it is not enforced. When the child learns on his own, at his own rate.
You want your child to be interested in reading? Make your home a library. Not so fancy or anything. Just surround the room and tables with books. Read it to your baby even when you think the baby doesn’t understand a single word. Let the unsupervised learning happen. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let the brain enjoy the feel of reading. The idea of living many lives through these books. Every character in these stories will add to the learning. And by the time the child grows, the brain is already hooked to this habit of reading. It has tasted the palatable food of reading. And it can’t survive without it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, you want him to be a musician. You already know what you need to do.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do you realize, what have you done by reading out everyday to your child?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
You have introduced a bias in your child’s character. A good bias, I would say. How interesting is that we can relate machine-learning and a child’s learning behaviors. And, we all know what happens to a biased model. It doesn’t work well. There is a &lt;a href="http://scott.fortmann-roe.com/docs/BiasVariance.html"&gt;trade-off&lt;/a&gt; between bias and variance you know.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
While, it’s good to have the child spend time with good people and have a nurtured learning. The child would know about the right things. But don’t stop your child from interacting with someone who is not in your good books. Let us call that someone Asura.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now Asura may not be on good terms with you and you may have legitimate reasons for that. Maybe you feel that Asura is immoral and unscrupulous. But you have seen only a part of Asura’s character. Maybe Asura is an excellent guitar player or a seasoned writer or he could be an expert in other domains. You don’t know.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let his learning be flexible. Let the bad data be part of his life. Let him enjoy the outliers as well, be it a good or a bad one. With the bad outlier — Asura, make sure you enforce a little of your experience and monitor the child’s learning of good and the evil. Let the supervised learning come into play.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Don’t let your child have limited experiences of just the right things. Don’t limit the datasets in his life or the variance will be huge which again is not a good thing.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Let the learning be both a mix of unsupervised and supervised. A semi-supervised learning we call it in data-science.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn’t have much idea about the speakers who were going to present. All I knew was, we wanted to get some good talent for our company and we had set up a booth where we were presenting the work we do at WalmartLabs.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Of all the speakers that presented their talk, one was mesmerizing. I was impressed by this speaker. The way he confidently took the stage. Stood casually by the dais. He didn’t carry any presentation with him unlike the other speakers. There was a charm and calmness in his presence. It was as if he knew that we were eagerly waiting to hear him out.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He introduced himself as &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ravi-venkatesan-ba15b820"&gt;Ravi Venkatesan&lt;/a&gt;. He gave a brief background about his college, the works he had done, and the great experiences he had in his career of 30 years. Nothing unusual or impressive so far. But when he mentioned the different fields in which he had done his work, I was awestruck. I was not able to digest the fact that he had worked as someone who established Microsoft in India during its early years after having manufactured engines in his previous job. See the difference in the two kinds of work.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Many had asked him not to take this job at Microsoft. That it was not safe to make such a change from working on engines to IT sector. Even his most trusted mentors were not in favor of this change. But this guy wanted to wear this new hat and take this risk. Not to prove anyone wrong but to ensure that later in his life he never had the guilt of not trying.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People generally don’t try new things because they fear the idea of failing. The moment one conquers this feeling and see beyond…all one can see is opportunity, learning, and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
He was in no hurry to finish up his talk. Slowly, he went on describing his journey of ups-and-downs. His talk was mostly on advices on career.
I remember him mentioning this.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The age of 40 is a magical year. Once you reach this, you start getting serious. You have in front of you, the 40 years you have already lived, you have the list of things you wanted to accomplish, and the things you have actually conquered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next thought that comes to your mind is you don’t have much time left. A few more years and your career will come to a halt. In the next few years, you would like to get the most out of your life. Do not wait to reach this magical year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do things you want to do NOW. Get out of your comfort zone. Take risks. His words were powerful and convincing.
Another anecdote from his life. He had applied for Harvard just after graduating from IIT Bombay. Sadly, he was rejected. Dejected and shattered, he called upon the office asking why was he rejected?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The person on the other side replied — &lt;em&gt;you don’t have anything different&lt;/em&gt;. Your grades are good and all but how are you different? He had no answer.
Few years passed by. Ravi liked reading about various things. He started writing about these things. His interest towards writing increased exponentially and fortunately at the age of 26, he became the youngest man to have his article published in the &lt;strong&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/strong&gt;. Obviously, he got admitted to Harvard the next time.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
My eyes glistened with awe.
Here was a guy who had not given up. He continued doing things he liked and gave an answer to how he was different from others.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The auditorium echoed with claps from the audience. The speaker opened up for questions from the audience which he patiently answered. There were many in the audience who had more questions to be answered. Time was running short and he had to leave the stage for the next speaker to come.

The learnings I had moving from college to corporate.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Things I have learned (So Far)&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I graduated from my college almost six months back. The last six months have been exciting in many ways. The transition from being a college student to a full-time corporate employee has been enlightening. In this post I will talk about some of the things which I've learnt... so far.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Travel-On&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just few days after my college, I traveled for some 20 days and those days were some of the good days I'll always cheer. Uttarakhand is beautiful.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Talk to people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are interesting. Every person has something interesting to share, something that makes you feel happy. Try to live the happiness of others by experiencing how their happiness makes you feel. You would be able to relate something from their reasons for happiness.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Trekkings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I won’t say I am a hardcore trekker- someone how has got a all his gadgets ready to hop on for next trek. But I’ve trekked around Bangalore a few times. And man! You get to know so much about people. If you want to know about a person, know some of his truest qualities, go on a long trek with him.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Smile and laugh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office gets boring sometimes, the work gets bland. You get the feeling right? You don’t hate your job but sometimes you just feel &lt;em&gt;aaj kaam na ho paaega yaar office me&lt;/em&gt; &lt;I don’t feel like working today&gt;, that time, a thought of only a few of your office friends make you come to the office. Those people are mostly who smile and talk to people.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Guitarest&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;oh sorry I meant The Greatest!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guitar is happiness. Think about your happiness. What makes you happy? There would be some activity in your daily life which you truly adore doing. Know the feeling I’m talking about. Guitar is that feeling to me.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
More on this soon.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="life"></category><category term="life lessons"></category></entry><entry><title>My first attempt at public speaking</title><link href="http://manishbarnwal.github.io/blog/2016/06/27/first_attempt_at_public%20speaking/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2016-06-27T07:00:00-03:00</updated><author><name>Manish Barnwal</name></author><id>tag:manishbarnwal.github.io,2016-06-27:blog/2016/06/27/first_attempt_at_public speaking/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Having graduated from college, it was just 6 months into my new job that I was asked to give a tech-talk on &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Data Science&lt;/em&gt;. Imagine the thrill and fright of a fresher when he is presented with a situation like this. The first thing I asked my manager was — how many people are we expecting in the audience? Notice the fright in the question. I was scared that I might screw up in front of a large audience. I may not be able to present the talk eloquently, the audience may laugh at me and all those crappy thoughts that quickly clouds your mind with fear and uncertainty.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Without much thought and ignoring the above questions, I straight away agreed to present the talk. &lt;strong&gt;The plan was simple&lt;/strong&gt;. Commit to the task and then learn how to do it. In a few days, after a lot many iterations I had the presentation ready with me. I had not prepared any script or dialogues for the talk. The reason being, I wanted to give an impromptu talk. Days passed and I got busy in routine office work and meeting project deadlines.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Writing and public-speaking was something that has always fascinated me. I had read many a posts on effective public-speaking. Now was the time to apply whatever I had read about it.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The day had come when I had to give the tech-talk. That morning, I woke up a little early and I looked at a few videos on dealing with the stage-fear. I found this video in particular to be helpful.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It’s not that I had not practiced at all. We had a few dry runs. Frankly, I didn’t had the exact lines that I intended to say. I had just planned the overall flow of the talk. As I had read on various blogs on public-speaking, I reached the conference room a little early, walked down the room confidently, talked to some of my colleagues about random topics so as to divert the attention and calm the nerves. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Within a few minutes, the room got packed with folks from various teams. I hadn’t expected these many people to turn around. Nevertheless, I was happy and confident. I kept saying this to myself — &lt;em&gt;you are going to rock today! So many people have come just to listen to you. You know this stuff. This is your bread and butter&lt;/em&gt;. I took a few deep breaths and started the talk. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After first few minutes of the talk, I started reading some of the faces in the audience, trying to understand if they are following what was being spoken. A good proxy for this include people asking questions, nodding to your statements in agreement, and making notes. I could see the audience doing these. So the feedback was good and I continued with the talk.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It was not all that easy. I stammered in between, fell short of the right words, the throat felt thirsty, some of the faces in audience looked scary but somehow the confidence in me was at peak. &lt;strong&gt;I was happy talking about something that I enjoyed doing&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It has been almost a year since I had presented this talk. Now when I think about it, I feel good. I feel accomplished. I know I could have screwed up badly. I had to start somewhere. And today I am happy that I did take that chance.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Next time, don’t let that chance pass away. Take that risk, prepare well and make it your first attempt at public speaking. We all need to start somewhere.

Many students find attending PPTs a waste of time. I was not one of them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I liked attending PPTs. I felt they gave me continuous motivation to be consistent in my preparation. I remember the first PPT I'd attended. It was EXL and it felt like almost every final year student was in that room. Not a single chair in &lt;em&gt;Kalidas Auditorium&lt;/em&gt; was unoccupied.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Looking at such a big crowd of students in that auditorium, me and my friend looked at each other with confused looks. We exchanged these words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: "Yaar Rahul, yaha toh bahot log hai be. Competition tagda hai be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahul: "Ho jaaega be. Naukri hi toh hai."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes the competition is going to be tough. So be prepared. I'm not trying to scare you. I'm just saying give your best shot at preparing for the companies you're interested in. It's just a matter of few months. I remember I'd studied more in that semester than all the previous semesters combined. This semester is an opportunity to learn the maximum out of your college life. Make it count.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I always made it a practice to take notes of the presentations I was attending. And then when needed I would look at them and try to understand what exactly is the company looking for. Be the boring one and take notes.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Following are the snippets of some of the companies I could find in my mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing new, it comes every year but may be...this is new for you and I'm talking to those who're about to witness probably the most important phase of their college life.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First things first. I'll start with a disclaimer - "Everything written on this space is my personal experience which is definitely not a statistically significant sample size"
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The very first question that comes to a typical final year student- What should I start my preparation with? You've got to do a lot, you know that but you don't know what to start with?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'll help you out here. I'd started with the &lt;strong&gt;TnPedia&lt;/strong&gt; (this is specific to just students from IIT Kharagpur; others please ignore this).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Heard of TnPedia? I'm sure you'd have. If not, just download it from dc++. Ohh yes! dc is used for useful stuff as well apart from the 'general daily stuff'. Download the last three years TnPedia and read through the companies you're targeting. This'll give you an overview of what is expected in an interview, what procedures are followed in different companies, you may also gain some insight to what kind of preparation is needed for a particular company.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now that you have given a thorough read to your target companies. Start preparing accordingly. I'll try to give a brief introduction as to what preparation is needed for different profiles.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CONSULTING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor Cheng is your friend. Super-smart guy. Download his video lectures(again dc++)  to get an understanding of what solving a case-study looks like. I'd suggest you to subscribe to his email newsletters as well. Those will help you in slowly gaining the overall idea of consulting.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Preparing for this takes time and you'll have to be persistent. Practise with your wingies, your department friends, anyone...but practise!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do the role play.
Some of you become the interviewer and one of you could be the interviewee. I know it sounds weird. But trust me you'll learn a lot. You'll overcome your anxiety of facing the interviewers. At first the role-play thing won't go that fine but with time it'll be smooth and everyone involved will come out beneficial.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Share your feedback about each other. I remember I used to get a lot aggressive while participating in mock group discussions with my friends. You sure will get to know about your weaknesses. Work on these weaknesses before it's too late. By doing this, you get a chance to commit all your mistakes before the real interview and that's a good thing.
Enough words. It's time to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being pro-active is the key."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources for preparation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the video lectures from dc++. Some 10 videos are there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribe to &lt;a href="http://www.caseinterview.com/homepage-new?utm_expid=6333140-12.n1MK6GEfT5qHocwp2COITg.1&amp;amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstuffedtomato.quora.com%2FThe-placement-season"&gt;case interview emails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case in point. The pdf is easily available on dc++ or online as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practise your basic math skills. You can't afford to make calculation mistakes in interview. &lt;a href="https://www.caseinterview.com/math/home.php"&gt;CaseInterview&lt;/a&gt; will improve your calculation speed and accuracy
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Case-interview is all about practise. After going through some frameworks you'll feel like you've earned the mastery over this but I guarantee you'll find this wrong once you actually solve a case-study problem in a real interview set-up. So practise, practise and practise.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That's all for now. I'll add about other job profiles soon as time permits. No more a free bird like I used to be in Kgp. Next update would be on Coding.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CODING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about coding preparation. Coding was one thing which I'd started learning and practicing only during my placement preparation. Prior to that I never really liked it. Actually I'd never really put much effort into it. And let me tell you this - Coding is interesting stuff to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the resources that I'd found helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.in/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Made-Easy/dp/145654988X/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1468958573&amp;amp;sr=1-5&amp;amp;keywords=Data+Structures+And+Algorithms+Made+Easy"&gt;Data Structures And Algorithms Made Easy&lt;/a&gt;. You get this book in Java, C and C++ version. Get the one in which you're comfortable with. For a starter like me, I'd read the C version.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The above should suffice for a normal coding preparation. I'll add more soon. I'll ask some of my coder friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. Next update would be on puzzles and brainteasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best for the placements. Prepare well.

I looked around, gained my consciousness and a thought thundered into my mind –I was not in Kgp. Not anymore. Life at Kgp is now a past, a past which will always be cherished and remembered as the guide of all my future endeavors. I had heard that time flies but this fast I didn’t had even an iota of idea. The five years passed by in a blink.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
When  you leave Kgp, you find yourself juggling with thoughts. You experience mixed emotions of both happiness and sadness or rather a term –‘beautiful sadness’ perfectly contain these feelings. You feel sad for the life of peace is over –the phenomenal five years. At the same time you find yourself smiling that Kgp happened to you, that you had your best time here, that you couldn’t have imagined a better college life.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Thank you Kgp for making me what I’m today and know that you’ll play a prominent role in whatever I aspire to become in my future. You are one of the best things that has happened to me in my past five years. Kgp, you have introduced me to some of the most amazing people, well some weird ones as well and a fewer limited editions.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now that we’re separated, I feel the void that has been created between us. But know that no one can ever fill this space of yours. You will always be special and I want you to know that just a thought of yours will automatically bring a smile on my lips. Thank you for the wonderful time we had together. Kgp, thou shall always be missed.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Yours forever,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;--Just another Kgpian&lt;/p&gt;

I did a quick Google and landed to the official site of our institute. That was the first time and also the last time when I had paid close attention to each of the tabs in the site. The five years of stay at this land has been phenomenal. I know time flies but this fast, I had no idea.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So I started my first year with full innocence, attended almost all my classes the first few days after which I came to know about this beautiful concept--proxy. The first year passed mostly in making new friends, understanding DC++, giving auditions for societies I had no idea about whatsoever, celebrating birthdays--GPLand attending a few classes. Needless to say, I had screwed my CGPA badly.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Something happened in the very beginning of 2nd year. I got serious with my academics, a little and then I met Professor G.P Raja Sekhar. Well, he needs no introduction. We had 9 credits under him, such a strict professor he was that I managed to attend almost all his classes even the 7:30 ones. That helped and I ended up improving my CGPA. Thank you Sir. I owe this one to you.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Third year went normal –attending a few more classes, this time in our department mostly. I had my internship at IDRBT–an RBI institute in Hyderabad. I feel this internship opportunity is highly under-rated. I urge all you juniors to have a look at this opportunity. I met some juniors and a few seniors of our department. One can find a Kgpian in almost every city. Two months internship got over like a breeze.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Fourth year, this is the time when you get to know the real competition –internship season. Some 10 students could manage to get an internship offer from TnP. The rest of us tried our luck off-campus. I landed up in Mumbai at CRISIL Limited for internship. Mumbai is a city full of life and happenings.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then came the final year –the placement season. You end up attending more PPTs than your classes. This green site–TnP automatically becomes your homepage. You study more in these four months than all of your first four years combined. A typical day consists of getting CV reviews from your seniors, discussing puzzles, brushing up your coding skills, solving case studies and attending some PPTs. Being proactive is the key. Be well prepared and you will bag your dream job quite easily. Talk to relevant seniors –they know a lot.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was offered the job of statistical analyst at WalmartLabs. The interview revolved mostly around Statistics, my internships and a few puzzles. Having placed, the last semester is a total delight. You are about to leave your institute so all your emotional chords get stroked.  You wonder doing all things which you might have missed during your four years stay at IIT Kharagpur.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I wish all the very best to my junior batch in their future endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won't get a life like Kgp anywhere else. Make it count.&lt;/p&gt;

Women’s day started as a Socialist political movement but over time it has changed to a day when it’s celebrated as a sign of respect and love to women across the world. Women’s day is all about respecting and caring for women around you. Take some time to wish and appreciate women in your life. Not that you shouldn’t love them on any ordinary day. All I’m saying is –&lt;em&gt;It’s their day. Make it special just like you do on someone’s birthday&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Give a call or pay a visit to your mother, wife, daughter, girlfriend, colleague or any women who has stood by you and supported you through the ups and downs of your life. &lt;em&gt;Don’t let this pass like just another day&lt;/em&gt;. Wish them. Tell them that you are thankful to them; I guarantee you their smile –a beautiful smile in return.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I called my mother, wished her, and made her smile. &lt;strong&gt;Did you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="life"></category><category term="women's day"></category><category term="happy"></category></entry><entry><title>The Walmart Interview</title><link href="http://manishbarnwal.github.io/blog/2014/03/04/walmart_interview/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-03-04T08:00:00-03:00</updated><author><name>Manish Barnwal</name></author><id>tag:manishbarnwal.github.io,2014-03-04:blog/2014/03/04/walmart_interview/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Now that you are reading this, I’ll assume that you are someone looking for an opportunity of placement or an internship. Go ahead and read. You have a long journey to cover.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was offered a job of Statistical Analyst at WalmartLabs. Let me guide you through their placement procedure. Sometime in October, we had the Pre-placement talk (we call it PPT here) where we were introduced to the company’s fundamentals, its businesses and some awesomeness of Walmart. The guy presenting the PPT looked geeky without paying much heed to if we were at all listening. But frankly, he had covered almost everything.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A month later, we had the online test which was based on statistical questions covering mostly topics such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypothesis Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R square&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic probability distribution functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence interval
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It also had 2 coding questions out of which I somehow managed to write the logic of one of them. The duration of the test was 90 minutes. I had started with statistical questions first and later moved to the coding part. My friends who had started with the coding questions were not able to attempt some very easy statistics questions. My advice to you is, go for the objective statistics questions first.  I managed to attempt some 17 questions out of a total of 23 questions. Based on the performance in the test a further shortlist of 7 students was declared. Needless to say I was one of them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So I was selected for the personal interview of WalmartLabs. A lot had to be done. I didn’t know where to start. The first thing I did was to talk to one of my seniors, Manikanta Dinesh. His advice and suggestions helped. A lot. I kept myself surrounded with books for quite a few days. I had interviews for a few other companies as well. I couldn't put all my energy into this one company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t keep all your fruits in one basket. Diversify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It was day 1, 1st December. I was selected in only one company.  CGPA plays a crucial part. If you have a low CGPA, chances are that you will see students getting shortlisted and your name won’t grace any of the lists. I know that feeling. You see, CGPA plays its part. A strong one.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Next day, Day 2, the only company to appear for – WalmartLabs. So I took all the interview funda from a friend, actually a mentor, Tushar – well, he knew more about interviews at that time, Day 1 placed at Credit Suisse. Having all well-prepared, suited up, drove my cycle to Nalanda Complex. On my way, I kept blabbering and preparing my answers, mostly the introduction part. You see, how you open the interview is important.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Though there were 2 HR guys from Walmart, the 1st round was a Skype interview. I had the experience of talking to my girlfriend at Skype. So 1st round well. That was just said in jest. The 1st round lasted for some 50 minutes. I was asked mostly about my internship at &lt;a href="http://www.idrbt.ac.in/"&gt;IDRBT&lt;/a&gt;. A few puzzles – 3 doors puzzle or the famous &lt;a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/monty-hall.html"&gt;Monty hall&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to answer almost all the puzzles. The interviewer was a CS graduate from IIT Bombay working at WalmartLabs for the past 6 years. How do I know? You ask. Well, I had asked him about it towards the end of the interview where you get to ask questions to the interviewer.
“Never miss this opportunity. Always ask questions. Period.”
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So the 1st round went well. Two of my friends couldn’t make to the 2nd round. This round was a Skype interview as well. This guy, the interviewer was a dude. We talked – I didn’t feel like it was an interview for some 90 minutes. Some very basic concepts of statistics were talked about. Some of which I recall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you explain probability to your grandmother?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you teach statistics to a layman?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are assumptions of linear regression? What are their implications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few puzzles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain your work at CRISIL Ltd.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Confident of my grasp at Statistics, the interviewer moved towards courses like Real Analysis and Measure Theory.
Question: Tell me about Cauchy’s law of convergence?
I was blank. Total blank. Few seconds passed. I muttered a few words vaguely. Finally I reiterated confidently. “Sir, I don’t remember this as of now. I didn’t like these courses much. But if you want me to know these subjects, I can very well be versed in them given a day or two.”
Guess what? He was impressed by my say. He said – “Not a problem Manish! I was just curious. You are good in Statistics and that is what mostly matters here.”
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The 3rd round started with only two of us in the game now. The interviewer was a senior executive from US. He asked some general questions from my CV. No more puzzles. This round too lasted for some 50 minutes. Finishing this round, I expected they would announce their result. But they had more in their basket. The other friend of mine couldn’t clear the 3rd round.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The 4th round was an HR round with one of the 2 guys who were present there. This lasted for some 15 minutes. By this time, I was determined – determined to be selected. Cleared it with a smile.
Yes there was a 5th round –a telephonic interview with the senior HR, Bangalore office. Again a 30 minutes interview. Some of the questions I recall:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Walmart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is your best buddy? Worst buddy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your greatest weakness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any questions you would like to ask?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The time now was 7:00 p.m. I was waiting for the result of longest interview of my life, walking restlessly outside the room. Waited for some 15 minutes. I could see the HR guys talking and discussing intensely over phone. A few more minutes passed. The wait was getting heavy now. The HR guy finally came out and with a broad smile, he said –“Congratulations! Welcome to the team.”
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That moment I knew what success tasted like. I was happy, excited. Overwhelmed! All of a sudden, I felt like a hero. They clicked a photo of me wearing the Walmart cap. They gave me a bag of gifts as a sign of welcome. On my way to hall, I gave a quick call to my father and then to my maa –She said she had been worshipping the whole day. Her prayers had played their charms and she was thankful to her Gods.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Reached my wing, told my friends and then they congratulated –GPL. The night was great. It called for a celebration. We headed to the bar. Time for some drinks.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
One final thought:&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ek din hota hai, ek job hota hai aur ek tum hote ho.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
