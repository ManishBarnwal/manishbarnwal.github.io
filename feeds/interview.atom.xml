Many students find attending PPTs a waste of time. I was not one of them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I liked attending PPTs. I felt they gave me continuous motivation to be consistent in my preparation. I remember the first PPT I'd attended. It was EXL and it felt like almost every final year student was in that room. Not a single chair in &lt;em&gt;Kalidas Auditorium&lt;/em&gt; was unoccupied.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Looking at such a big crowd of students in that auditorium, me and my friend looked at each other with confused looks. We exchanged these words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Me: "Yaar Rahul, yaha toh bahot log hai be. Competition tagda hai be."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahul: "Ho jaaega be. Naukri hi toh hai."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes the competition is going to be tough. So be prepared. I'm not trying to scare you. I'm just saying give your best shot at preparing for the companies you're interested in. It's just a matter of few months. I remember I'd studied more in that semester than all the previous semesters combined. This semester is an opportunity to learn the maximum out of your college life. Make it count.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I always made it a practice to take notes of the presentations I was attending. And then when needed I would look at them and try to understand what exactly is the company looking for. Be the boring one and take notes.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Following are the snippets of some of the companies I could find in my mobile.&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing new, it comes every year but may be...this is new for you and I'm talking to those who're about to witness probably the most important phase of their college life.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
First things first. I'll start with a disclaimer - "Everything written on this space is my personal experience which is definitely not a statistically significant sample size"
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The very first question that comes to a typical final year student- What should I start my preparation with? You've got to do a lot, you know that but you don't know what to start with?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I'll help you out here. I'd started with the &lt;strong&gt;TnPedia&lt;/strong&gt; (this is specific to just students from IIT Kharagpur; others please ignore this).
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Heard of TnPedia? I'm sure you'd have. If not, just download it from dc++. Ohh yes! dc is used for useful stuff as well apart from the 'general daily stuff'. Download the last three years TnPedia and read through the companies you're targeting. This'll give you an overview of what is expected in an interview, what procedures are followed in different companies, you may also gain some insight to what kind of preparation is needed for a particular company.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now that you have given a thorough read to your target companies. Start preparing accordingly. I'll try to give a brief introduction as to what preparation is needed for different profiles.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CONSULTING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victor Cheng is your friend. Super-smart guy. Download his video lectures(again dc++)  to get an understanding of what solving a case-study looks like. I'd suggest you to subscribe to his email newsletters as well. Those will help you in slowly gaining the overall idea of consulting.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Preparing for this takes time and you'll have to be persistent. Practise with your wingies, your department friends, anyone...but practise!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Do the role play.
Some of you become the interviewer and one of you could be the interviewee. I know it sounds weird. But trust me you'll learn a lot. You'll overcome your anxiety of facing the interviewers. At first the role-play thing won't go that fine but with time it'll be smooth and everyone involved will come out beneficial.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Share your feedback about each other. I remember I used to get a lot aggressive while participating in mock group discussions with my friends. You sure will get to know about your weaknesses. Work on these weaknesses before it's too late. By doing this, you get a chance to commit all your mistakes before the real interview and that's a good thing.
Enough words. It's time to execute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Being pro-active is the key."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources for preparation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download the video lectures from dc++. Some 10 videos are there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subscribe to &lt;a href="http://www.caseinterview.com/homepage-new?utm_expid=6333140-12.n1MK6GEfT5qHocwp2COITg.1&amp;amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fstuffedtomato.quora.com%2FThe-placement-season"&gt;case interview emails&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Case in point. The pdf is easily available on dc++ or online as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practise your basic math skills. You can't afford to make calculation mistakes in interview. &lt;a href="https://www.caseinterview.com/math/home.php"&gt;CaseInterview&lt;/a&gt; will improve your calculation speed and accuracy
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Case-interview is all about practise. After going through some frameworks you'll feel like you've earned the mastery over this but I guarantee you'll find this wrong once you actually solve a case-study problem in a real interview set-up. So practise, practise and practise.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That's all for now. I'll add about other job profiles soon as time permits. No more a free bird like I used to be in Kgp. Next update would be on Coding.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CODING&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's talk about coding preparation. Coding was one thing which I'd started learning and practicing only during my placement preparation. Prior to that I never really liked it. Actually I'd never really put much effort into it. And let me tell you this - Coding is interesting stuff to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the resources that I'd found helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

You get this book in Java, C and C++ version. Get the one in which you're comfortable with. For a starter like me, I'd read the C version.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The above should suffice for a normal coding preparation. I'll add more soon. I'll ask some of my coder friends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's all for now. Next update would be on puzzles and brainteasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the best for the placements. Prepare well.
Any help needed?

Go ahead and read. You have a long journey to cover.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
I was offered a job of Statistical Analyst at WalmartLabs. Let me guide you through their placement procedure. Sometime in October, we had the Pre-placement talk (we call it PPT here) where we were introduced to the company’s fundamentals, its businesses and some awesomeness of Walmart. The guy presenting the PPT looked geeky without paying much heed to if we were at all listening. But frankly, he had covered almost everything.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
A month later, we had the online test which was based on statistical questions covering mostly topics such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypothesis Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;R square&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basic probability distribution functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Confidence interval
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It also had 2 coding questions out of which I somehow managed to write the logic of one of them. The duration of the test was 90 minutes. I had started with statistical questions first and later moved to the coding part. My friends who had started with the coding questions were not able to attempt some very easy statistics questions. My advice to you is, go for the objective statistics questions first.  I managed to attempt some 17 questions out of a total of 23 questions. Based on the performance in the test a further shortlist of 7 students was declared. Needless to say I was one of them.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So I was selected for the personal interview of WalmartLabs. A lot had to be done. I didn’t know where to start. The first thing I did was to talk to one of my seniors, Manikanta Dinesh. His advice and suggestions helped. A lot. I kept myself surrounded with books for quite a few days. I had interviews for a few other companies as well. I couldn't put all my energy into this one company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Don’t keep all your fruits in one basket. Diversify.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It was day 1, 1st December. I was selected in only one company.  CGPA plays a crucial part. If you have a low CGPA, chances are that you will see students getting shortlisted and your name won’t grace any of the lists. I know that feeling. You see, CGPA plays its part. A strong one.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Next day, Day 2, the only company to appear for – WalmartLabs. So I took all the interview funda from a friend, actually a mentor, Tushar – well, he knew more about interviews at that time, Day 1 placed at Credit Suisse. Having all well-prepared, suited up, drove my cycle to Nalanda Complex. On my way, I kept blabbering and preparing my answers, mostly the introduction part. You see, how you open the interview is important.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Though there were 2 HR guys from Walmart, the 1st round was a Skype interview. I had the experience of talking to my girlfriend at Skype. So 1st round well. That was just said in jest. The 1st round lasted for some 50 minutes. I was asked mostly about my internship at &lt;a href="http://www.idrbt.ac.in/"&gt;IDRBT&lt;/a&gt;. A few puzzles – 3 doors puzzle or the famous &lt;a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/monty-hall.html"&gt;Monty hall&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to answer almost all the puzzles. The interviewer was a CS graduate from IIT Bombay working at WalmartLabs for the past 6 years. How do I know? You ask. Well, I had asked him about it towards the end of the interview where you get to ask questions to the interviewer.
“Never miss this opportunity. Always ask questions. Period.”
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So the 1st round went well. Two of my friends couldn’t make to the 2nd round. This round was a Skype interview as well. This guy, the interviewer was a dude. We talked – I didn’t feel like it was an interview for some 90 minutes. Some very basic concepts of statistics were talked about. Some of which I recall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you explain probability to your grandmother?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How would you teach statistics to a layman?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are assumptions of linear regression? What are their implications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few puzzles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explain your work at CRISIL Ltd.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Confident of my grasp at Statistics, the interviewer moved towards courses like Real Analysis and Measure Theory.
Question: Tell me about Cauchy’s law of convergence?
I was blank. Total blank. Few seconds passed. I muttered a few words vaguely. Finally I reiterated confidently. “Sir, I don’t remember this as of now. I didn’t like these courses much. But if you want me to know these subjects, I can very well be versed in them given a day or two.”
Guess what? He was impressed by my say. He said – “Not a problem Manish! I was just curious. You are good in Statistics and that is what mostly matters here.”
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The 3rd round started with only two of us in the game now. The interviewer was a senior executive from US. He asked some general questions from my CV. No more puzzles. This round too lasted for some 50 minutes. Finishing this round, I expected they would announce their result. But they had more in their basket. The other friend of mine couldn’t clear the 3rd round.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The 4th round was an HR round with one of the 2 guys who were present there. This lasted for some 15 minutes. By this time, I was determined – determined to be selected. Cleared it with a smile.
Yes there was a 5th round –a telephonic interview with the senior HR, Bangalore office. Again a 30 minutes interview. Some of the questions I recall:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why Walmart?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is your best buddy? Worst buddy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your greatest weakness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any questions you would like to ask?
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The time now was 7:00 p.m. I was waiting for the result of longest interview of my life, walking restlessly outside the room. Waited for some 15 minutes. I could see the HR guys talking and discussing intensely over phone. A few more minutes passed. The wait was getting heavy now. The HR guy finally came out and with a broad smile, he said –“Congratulations! Welcome to the team.”
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That moment I knew what success tasted like. I was happy, excited. Overwhelmed! All of a sudden, I felt like a hero. They clicked a photo of me wearing the Walmart cap. They gave me a bag of gifts as a sign of welcome. On my way to hall, I gave a quick call to my father and then to my maa –She said she had been worshipping the whole day. Her prayers had played their charms and she was thankful to her Gods.

Reached my wing, told my friends and then they congratulated –GPL. The night was great. It called for a celebration. We headed to the bar. Time for some drinks.

One final thought:&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ek din hota hai, ek job hota hai aur ek tum hote ho.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
